This mod adds IUS ASE structure for Benjee10's Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit and CobaltWolf's BDB.

What is IUS ASE?
IUS - Inertial Upper Stage
ASE - Airborne Support Equipment
ASE is needed to support IUS during lift-off and elevate IUS from Shuttle's payload bay for deployment.

Installation: move the "ShuttlePayloadDeliverySystems" folder to your GameData folder.

Dependencies:
- ModuleManager
- Breaking Ground DLC
- Bluedog Design Bureau
- Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit


Hope you like it :)

This is my first attempt at modding KSP (actually the second one, but it was only textures). So I would like to thank Zorg for helping me create the mod and of course whole Kerbal Community discord server for supporting me.

I also plan to add same things for Centaur G and G-Prime and for Centaur III. Also I plan to add more payload stuff for shuttle like SpaceLab Palette, SpaceHab, sun shade and more.
