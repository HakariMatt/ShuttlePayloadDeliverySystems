This is my first attempt at modding KSP (actually the second one, but it was only textures). So I would like to thank Zorg and CobaltWolf for helping me create the mod and of course whole Kerbal Community discord server for supporting me.

I also plan to add adapter for Centaur III and more payload stuff for shuttle like SpaceLab Palette, SpaceHab, sun shade and more.
